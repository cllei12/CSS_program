# Programs, Researchers, Groups on Computational Social Science

This project keeps a record of master/phd programs , as well as researchers and industry groups working in computational social science. The aim of the project is to help students/researchers interested in computational social science with graduate application and job search.

## Disclaimer! 

The programs/researchers/groups listed in this document in the field of computational social science are for reference only, with the purpose of facilitating information flow and sharing. The inclusion of these researchers/program does not imply our endorsement of their institutions, projects, or research directions. We encourage readers to further explore and evaluate these researchers and their institutions based on their own needs.

## What is Computational Social Science?
Formally, the idea of compuatational social science research is initiated in a [Science paper](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.1167742?casa_token=_cfPz3X3Rm4AAAAA%3AVTQelmhEE36GXIJ5nsbpuDQcM_A31Axi8u655kvGG0nGxWIDntiR6YDbKaFdzrMW20OFIdhzmfaiog) published in 2009. It is an rising interdisciplinary academic sub-field concerned with computational approaches to the social sciences, and is attracting more and more researchers into the field.

## Why we create this document?
As a relatively new and interdisciplinary field, computational social science attracts researchers from diverse domains and institutions. However, formal academic structures, such as dedicated departments of computational social science, are rare, making it challenging to identify relevant researchers and programs. To cope with the problem, we have created this document to facilitate information sharing within the field, helping interested students and researchers find suitable programs, collaborators, and advisors.

Given the large number of researchers/programs in the domain, it is practically impossible for us to include everyone in the field, and it is not the goal as well. We hope this document can be a go-to place when looking for resources in the domain, though not exhaustive.

## How should I use this project?
You can use the following documents to find programs/groups/researchers related to computational social science.

**Master/PhD Programs** contains a list of master and phd programs in computational social science. It is organized based on country/regions, so that you can look for programs in your desired country/region. 

**Researchers** contains a list of researchers working on computational social science. It is organized based on research topics, so that you can look for researchers in the topic you are interested in.

**Industry Groups** contains a list of industry groups working on computational social science, organized by country/regions. It is helpful for internship search, and for researchers looking for industry position.

## How to contribute to the project?
We welcome all contributions to the project, please submit pull requests or issues to add information you know, and to provide feedback.

Particularly, if you want to add new information about program/researcher/group via issues, please add the name and a link to personal/official website so that we can verify the information.

Here is a simple template you are encouraged to use when adding new information:

  - Name (of the researcher/group/program)
  - Link (link to official or personal website)
  - Comments (For example, reasons to add, this item is optional)

If you want to add new information via pull requests, please edit the content in the files we created (i.e. Master/PhD Programs; Researchers; Industry Groups), and follow the format used in the existing document.

There is no strict rule about who counts as computational social sciensts. Generally speaking, researchers with a quantative and computational mindset and works on social problems should qualify to be added. We will provide feedback if your suggestion is not added.

We thank everyone who contributes to the project.
